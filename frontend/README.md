# DaphneUI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Installation

After installing Node.js and npm, install the Angular CLI (more information can be found Angular's official documentation):
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Configuration

Before running the UI you might also have to configure the API endpoint at [`./src/app/core/services/config.service.ts`](src/app/core/services/config.service.ts)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a development server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). (Actual testing is currently missing).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
